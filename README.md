👋 Hi, I’m @nachotrossero, I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 🇦🇷
👀 I’m interested in 🎞️ movies, 📚 books, 🎮 video games, 🐶 dogs and, right now, learning how to 💻 code step by step. 
🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, CSS, HTML and Node.Js. I am having a good time learning with my classmates and we support each other every sprint
🌠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn by doing on a colaborative culture 🦾, and hopefully someday I would love to be a part of a great team of developers. 
📫 You can reach me on 🔵Twitter here [@nachotrossero](https://twitter.com/nachotrossero).
